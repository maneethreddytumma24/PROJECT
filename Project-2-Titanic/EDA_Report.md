# Project 2: Titanic Data Cleaning and Passenger Analysis

## 1. Objective

The objective of this project is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the Titanic dataset to identify factors that influenced passenger survival. The project also demonstrates data cleaning techniques, statistical analysis, outlier detection, grouping, filtering, and data visualization using Python.

# 2. Dataset Information

- Dataset: Titanic (train.csv)
- Source: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
- Total Records: 891
- Original Features: 12
- Features after Cleaning: 11

---

# 3. Data Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Filled missing values in the **Age** column using the median.
- Filled missing values in the **Embarked** column using the mode.
- Removed the **Cabin** column due to a high percentage of missing values.
- Checked for duplicate records and removed them if present.
- Verified that no missing values remained after cleaning.

---

# 4. Statistical Analysis

The following statistical measures were calculated:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

These statistics provided insights into the distribution of numerical features such as Age, Fare, Passenger Class, and Family Size.

---

# 5. Outlier Detection

Outliers were detected in the **Fare** column using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Steps performed:

- Calculated Q1 and Q3
- Computed the IQR
- Determined lower and upper limits
- Identified outliers
- Capped extreme Fare values to reduce their impact while preserving the dataset

---

# 6. Data Filtering and Sorting

The dataset was filtered to analyze:

- Female passengers
- Passengers younger than 18 years
- First-class passengers

The dataset was also sorted according to Fare in descending order to identify passengers who paid the highest ticket prices.

---

# 7. GroupBy Analysis

The following analyses were performed:

- Average Fare by Passenger Class
- Average Age by Gender
- Survival Rate by Passenger Class

### Survival Rate by Passenger Class

| Passenger Class | Survival Rate |
|-----------------|---------------|
| First Class | 62.96% |
| Second Class | 47.28% |
| Third Class | 24.24% |

This indicates that passengers traveling in First Class had a significantly higher chance of survival.

---

# 8. Visualizations

The following charts were created:

- Bar Chart (Survival Count)
- Line Chart (Fare Distribution)
- Histogram (Age Distribution)
- Scatter Plot (Age vs Fare)
- Pie Chart (Survival Percentage)

These visualizations helped understand passenger demographics and survival trends.

---

# 9. Key Findings

- Most passengers belonged to Third Class.
- First-Class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Third-Class passengers had the lowest survival rate.
- Fare contained several high-value outliers.
- Age values were successfully imputed using the median.
- Passenger class played an important role in determining survival.

---

# 10. Conclusion

The Titanic dataset was successfully cleaned and analyzed. Missing values were handled, outliers were treated, and meaningful insights were extracted using statistical analysis and visualizations. The analysis revealed that passenger class had a strong relationship with survival, with First-Class passengers being much more likely to survive than Third-Class passengers.
